Never using the company again for finding future employees.Love the employee.Thank you for finding such a fast fit.Exactly who we needed.Wasn’t able to do the work.Great service! The worker just didn’t work this time.

Moving hiring to all internal.Thank you! .Not happy with this employee but overall great company.Error rate was unnaceptable.Late .Caught stealing from register. Immediately terminated. .THANKS.Annual fee is not worth this service.Can we have more resources on training new employees\n"
